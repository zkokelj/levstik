    So on this floor are commemorative plaques with the names of the creators, without which it is difficult to imagine learning about quality children's and youth literature. As they wrote in the Youth Book, Levstik's arcades symbolize the publishing house's fundamental commitment to children's and youth literature and are a tribute to authors who received the most prestigious award for their lifetime work in the field of children's literature.
    
    The publishing house also worked closely with the City of Ljubljana on the project. According to Mayor Janez Kozelj, 'the idea of ​​having a composer on Vegova's alley is really old, but it took a long time to show that this idea could have taken a slightly different form, realized '. Renovation of Levstik's arcades was placed in the frame of the renovation of Slovenska cesta.
